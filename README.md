This repo contains presentation **in russian** about my idea of social bus route in my district. This route will help people with limited mobility to travel to important social destinations. <br><br>
I used QGIS to draw the maps and QuickOSM plugin to gain data. Maps as images can be found in maps folder. <br><br>
Right now I am not going to translate the presentation to english, message me if you want me to.
